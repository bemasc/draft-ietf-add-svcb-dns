      "body": "Allowing the use of nonstandard port numbers in SVCB for DNS provides valuable operational flexibility, but it also creates a risk related to cross-protocol confusion attacks, in which a malicious server convinces a client to send TCP contents that can be misparsed as a different protocol by a non-TLS victim server.  For example, a malicious DNS server could indicate an SNI or session ticket that can be misparsed as a command by a recipient server, and use DNS rebinding to change its own apparent IP address to the victim server.  Clients would then send this server-controlled payload to the victim server.  This is dangerous if the client is implicitly authorized to control the victim server (e.g. authorization by IP address).\r\n\r\nNote that only DoT and DoH (over TCP) are amenable to these attacks.  QUIC Initial encryption ensures that the packet has no meaning to a recipient that is not QUIC-aware, and any QUIC-aware recipient should not be vulnerable to these attacks.\r\n\r\nWe should consider ways to minimize the impact of these attacks.  For example, we could require clients to restrict the value of the `port` parameter to a small fixed list, or refer to the [WHATWG bad port list](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#port-blocking).\r\n\r\nCredit to @davidben\r\n\r\n",

Let $PORT be the port from the \"port\" key if present, otherwise 443.  (The binding authority's port number MUST NOT be used.)\r\n   3.  Let $DOHPATH be the \"dohpath\" value, decoded from UTF-8.\r\n   4.

People don't like it when you normatively require implementation of a specific algorithm, because it artificially constrains implementation.  In this case, for example, a client could choose to omit the port number when it is unspecified, instead of setting it explicitly to 443.  This would undeniably result in a different DoH URI Template, although the resulting calculated URIs for each request would be equivalent in some sense.  A client could even skip computation of the full URI template, and instead perform substitution for each request directly on the `$DOHPATH` string, plugging `$HOST` and `$PORT` and the path into their HTTP client library without ever constructing a URI.",
